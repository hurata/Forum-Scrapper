# Forum Scrapper

* May require intermediate knowledge of GoLang. A primitive but ***realy powerful scrapper*** that I wrote 4 years ago.
* It works asynchronously and can work with proxies.
* If not used carefully, it may cause DDOS effect. (Tested!)
* I will make additions over time and try to turn it into a more organized structure.
